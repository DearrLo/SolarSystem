    <h3>Pioneers of astronomy</h3>

    <main>
        <p>
            From the first time people looked up at the stars, trying to make sense of what was out there, we’ve been on a path to understanding the universe. Ancient astronomers mapped the skies, laying down the basics, and then people like Copernicus and Galileo came along, flipping everything on its head by questioning our place in it all. Fast forward a few centuries, and suddenly we’re launching Sputnik, walking on the Moon, and sending rovers to Mars. Today, we're pushing even further, eyeing distant exoplanets and wondering what's next. It's more than curiosity—it’s this relentless drive to see just how far we can go.
