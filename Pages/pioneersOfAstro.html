                <h3>Antiquity - Early Dreamers and Astronomers</h3>
                <p class="paragraphe-pioneers">Since ancient times, civilizations like the Mesopotamians, Egyptians, and Greeks observed the stars and documented planetary movements, laying the foundation of astronomy. Figures like Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Copernicus asked fundamental questions about the nature of our universe, introducing revolutionary ideas about Earth's place in the cosmos. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="section2-div">
                    <h3>The Renaissance - the Beginnings of Modern Astronomy</h3>
                    <p class="paragraphe-pioneers">The Renaissance was a turning point in astronomy, where the idea of a heliocentric universe challenged ancient beliefs. Nicolas Copernicus introduced the revolutionary theory that the Sun, not the Earth, was the center of the solar system. Building on this, Johannes Kepler discovered the laws of planetary motion, proving planets move in elliptical orbits. Galileo Galilei, with his improved telescope, observed celestial phenomena like Jupiter's moons and the phases of Venus, providing strong evidence for the heliocentric model. This period marked the shift from philosophical speculation to scientific inquiry, laying the foundation for modern astronomy.</p>

                <div class="section3-div">
                    <h3>The Age of Classical Astronomy and the Scientific Revolution</h3>
                    <p class="paragraphe-pioneers">The 18th and 19th centuries marked significant progress in astronomy, combining advanced mathematics and improved instruments. Isaac Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation explained planetary orbits and celestial mechanics. Astronomers like William Herschel expanded the known solar system with the discovery of Uranus and mapped countless stars and nebulae. Tools like the spectroscope allowed the study of stars' composition, while star catalogs provided a structured understanding of the sky. This era laid the groundwork for modern astrophysics and deepened humanity's curiosity about the cosmos.</p>

                <div class="section4-div">
                    <h3>The Industrial Revolution and Advances in Astronomical Observations</h3>
                    <p class="paragraphe-pioneers">During the 19th and early 20th centuries, astronomy underwent a profound transformation, driven by technological advancements and theoretical breakthroughs. The discovery of Neptune in 1846, based on mathematical predictions, highlighted the precision of Newtonian mechanics and expanded the known boundaries of our solar system. Meanwhile, the invention of the spectroscope allowed scientists to analyze the chemical composition of stars, giving rise to astrophysics as a field. The emergence of photography revolutionized astronomical observations, enabling detailed tracking of celestial objects and uncovering the structure of our galaxy. Theoretical physics also advanced, with Einstein’s theories of relativity redefining space, time, and gravity, challenging Newtonian ideas. This period bridged the gap between classical astronomy and modern astrophysics, laying the groundwork for humanity’s leap into space in the 20th century.</p>
