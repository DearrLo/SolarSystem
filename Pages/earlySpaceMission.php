                <b>On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1</b>, the first-ever artificial satellite to orbit Earth. This small metallic sphere, 
                equipped with antennas, transmitted a simple "beep-beep" radio signal that could be heard across the globe. Though basic in its functionality, 
                Sputnik 1 was a monumental achievement, marking the start of the space age and sparking worldwide fascination—and competition—in space 
                exploration.

                Just a month later, <b>on November 3, 1957, the Soviets followed up with Sputnik 2</b>, a much larger satellite carrying the first living 
                creature into space: Laika, a stray dog from Moscow's streets. While Laika's journey was groundbreaking in studying the biological effects 
                of space travel, it was also controversial, as no plan existed to bring her back safely. Laika survived a few hours in orbit before succumbing
                to heat and stress.

                    <b>The United States entered the space race on January 31, 1958</b>, with the successful launch of <b>Explorer 1</b>,
                     their first satellite. Unlike Sputnik, Explorer 1 carried scientific instruments, leading to the discovery of the Van Allen
                      radiation belts surrounding Earth. This mission marked America's first significant contribution to space science,
                        intensifying the rivalry with the Soviet Union.

                    Later that year, <b>on March 17, 1958, the US launched Vanguard 1</b>, a tiny satellite just 15 cm in diameter. Though modest in size,
                     it remains significant for its longevity—it is still orbiting Earth today, making it the oldest human-made object in space.
                      Vanguard 1 helped scientists study Earth's atmosphere and the shape of its orbit, providing critical insights into the planet's
                     environment.

                    Finally, on <b>January 2, 1959, the Soviet Union made history again with Luna 1, the first spacecraft to escape Earth's gravity</b>.
                     Although it missed its intended target, the Moon, it became the first human-made object to orbit the Sun. Luna 1 set the stage for more 
                     ambitious lunar missions, symbolizing a major milestone in humanity\'s exploration of deep space.
