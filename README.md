# SolarSystem-v1

## Description:
This project represents a semi-static model of the solar system.  
It focuses on the use of CSS animations and includes an interactive menu.

## Context:
This project was created as part of my web development learning journey.  
It is a **first version**, mainly focused on design and CSS animations.  
I plan to improve it by adding dynamic features using JavaScript and other technologies.  
This project is still **a work in progress**, and I am currently working on new features.

## Features
- **CSS Animations**: Planet rotation, Sun pulsation, etc.
- **Interactive dropdown menu**: Navigation to different pages related to astronomy.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**: Used to structure pages and include reusable elements.

## Future Objectives
- Display dynamic information about planets on click.
- Make the site fully responsive for mobile.
- **Planned Version 2**:
  - Add animated orbits using JavaScript.
  - Use a JSON file or an API to dynamically load data.

## How to Launch the Project
